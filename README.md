Choose a quiet spot to train your tones. 

Bring up the menu by touching the upper-left icon (three horizontal lines). Choose Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Tones. Check "Enable Tones". Return to the deck by choosing the arrow in the upper-left corner.

When you review the deck, your screen should be divided in two halves. 

The bottom half shows the tones of a native speaker, and has a single 'play' button. Touch the play button to hear the reference speech again.

The top half is for your own speech, and has three buttons: record, stop, play. Touch the red 'record' button and say the word(s) on the flashcard out loud. Touch the 'play' button to listen to your own pronunciation.

The "karaoke" feature plays the reference speech while recording your voice. Use earphones when "karaoke" is enabled, else the microphone will pick up the loudspeaker instead of your voice..
